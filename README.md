# ML-My_Nearest_Neighbor

## Overview
A basic implementation of a Nearest-Neighbor classifier (basically a K-Nearest-Neigbors but where `k = 1`)

## Dependencies
The classifier (`MyNN.py`) only uses basic libraries such as `math` and `sys`.
The main file (`Main.py`) uses **sklearn** to get datasets and compute the classifier accuracy, but you **don't need it** if you want to use just the classifier. 

Run this command to get **sklearn** :
```
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Run the script
You can run this script in terminal with this command line :
```
python main.py
```
