# ML-MyKNearestNeighbors
## Overview
The `MyKNN.py` file contain my home-made version of the k-Nearest-Neighbors classifier.

By default `k = 5`, it means that the classifier will checks for the closest 5 neightbors of the data you want to test.

## Dependencies
The classifier only uses basic library (`math`, `sys` and `operator`), so you don't need dependencies to use it.

The main file (`main.py`) uses sklearn to get datasets, but you don't need it if you want to use just the classifier.


Run this command to get **sklearn** :
```
pip install scikit-learn
```
